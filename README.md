## TimeFighter Android Application

This is a simple android app that let's the users tap on a button and increment their score.

A countdown of 60 s was added to the app. Also, the user could change the orientation of his device and continue to hit new scores.

This application uses **savedInstanceState** to store data when the configuration of the device changes, especially when changing from/to landscape/portrait modes.
